# FLARE: Fractal Language for Autonomous Recursive Expansion

The FLARE language provides a powerful framework for recursive AI prompting. The ability to specify models, control response variability, and apply advanced post-processing functions enables developers to extract the most value from their AI tools. By leveraging multiple models, they can ensure diverse and accurate responses, similar to the "wisdom of the (llm) crowd" while post-processing functions like summarizing, combining, or contrasting these responses allow for nuanced and comprehensive outputs. This flexibility makes FLARE a versatile and valuable language for AI tool development.

## ✨ Key Features

- 🤖 **Multi-Model Support** - Query OpenAI, Mistral, and other models simultaneously
- 🧠 **Intelligent Post-Processing** - Vote, summarize, combine, and analyze responses
- ⚡ **High Performance** - Parallel model queries with automatic fallbacks
- 🏗️ **Atomic Architecture** - Maintainable, testable, and scalable codebase
- 📊 **Real-Time Monitoring** - Health checks, diagnostics, and API insights
- 🔧 **Easy Integration** - RESTful API with comprehensive error handling

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd FLARE

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Optional: Set up environment variables (works without API key!)
cp .env.example .env
```

### 2. Start the Server
```bash
# Start FLARE server
npm start

# Server runs on http://localhost:8080
# API available at http://localhost:8080/api/info
# Health check at http://localhost:8080/health
```

### 3. Test FLARE Commands
```bash
# Test with curl
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/process-flare \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"command": "{ flare model:mistral temp:0.7 `Write a haiku about AI` }"}'

# Or use the web interface at http://localhost:8080
```

## 🔑 API Configuration (Optional)

FLARE works out-of-the-box with fallback API access. For production use:

```bash
# .env file
POLLINATIONS_API_KEY=your_api_key_here     # Optional - fallback provided
PORT=8080                                  # Server port
```

Get your API key at [auth.pollinations.ai](https://auth.pollinations.ai)

## 🎯 FLARE Command Syntax

FLARE uses an intuitive curly-brace syntax to define AI orchestration commands:

```javascript
{ flare model:model_name temp:temperature post_processing `your prompt here` }
```

### 📝 Basic Examples

```javascript
// Single model query
{ flare model:mistral `Explain quantum computing` }

// Multiple models with voting
{ flare model:openai,mistral vote `What is the best programming language?` }

// Temperature control (0.0 = deterministic, 1.0+ = creative)
{ flare model:mistral temp:0.1 `Count from 1 to 5` }
{ flare model:mistral temp:0.9 `Write a creative story opening` }
```

### 🧠 Post-Processing Commands

| Command | Description | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| `sum` | Summarize multiple responses | `{ flare model:openai,mistral sum `Explain AI` }` |
| `vote` | Select the best response | `{ flare model:openai,mistral vote `Rate JavaScript 1-10` }` |
| `comb` | Combine all responses | `{ flare model:openai,mistral comb `List AI benefits` }` |
| `diff` | Compare responses | `{ flare model:openai,mistral diff `React vs Vue` }` |
| `exp` | Expand responses | `{ flare model:mistral exp `Explain machine learning` }` |
| `filter` | Filter quality responses | `{ flare model:openai,mistral filter `Pros and cons` }` |

### 🎛️ Parameters

- **`model`**: Specify one or more models (see available models below)
- **`temp`**: Control randomness (0.0-2.0, default: 1.0)
- **Post-processing**: Apply intelligent response processing

### 🤖 Available Models

FLARE integrates with Pollinations.ai and supports these anonymous-tier models:

| Model | Description | Specialization |

```

### Implementation Strategy

**Atomic Architecture Principles:**
- **One Function Per File** - Each `.js` file contains exactly one function with the same name
- **Maximum Modularity** - Functions are pure, testable, and composable
- **Clear Dependencies** - Import/export relationships are explicit and minimal
- **Language-Based Organization** - Structure follows code constructs, not application features

**Core Processing Pipeline:**
1. **Text Input** → `extractFlareCommands()` → Extract embedded FLARE commands
2. **FLARE Commands** → `parseFlareCommand()` → Parse syntax and parameters  
3. **Parsed Commands** → `queryMultipleModels()` → Execute model queries in parallel
4. **Raw Responses** → `applyPostProcessing()` → Apply intelligent post-processing
5. **Processed Results** → `replaceFlareCommands()` → Replace commands with results
6. **Final Output** → Seamlessly integrated natural text

This structure provides:
- ✅ **Ultimate Maintainability** - Individual functions are easy to locate, test, and modify
- ✅ **Perfect Testability** - Each function can be tested in isolation with clear inputs/outputs
- ✅ **Infinite Scalability** - New functionality adds new files without affecting existing code
- ✅ **Maximum Clarity** - Function names match file names for instant comprehension

## 💡 Document Processing with Embedded AI

### The Power of Seamless Integration

FLARE's `/process-text` endpoint enables **natural document processing** where AI-generated content seamlessly integrates into your text:
